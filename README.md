CLI bash script to quickly install/configure the system

This script is designed to streamline the process of setting up a Debian Linux system according to personal preferences. It provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to choose from various configuration options, such as adding a user to sudoers, installing system updates and applications, configuring SSH server, installing LAMB server, installing development tools, setting up security measures, and more.
